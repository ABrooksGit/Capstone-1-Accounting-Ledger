# Capstone-1-Accounting-Ledger
CAPSTONE 1

This application will track all all your deposits and payments.

How to:

Once the application starts you will see a welcoming statement and letter options to choose
from. 

The Home Screen:
These are where you see your first options. As you can see these will allow you to add a deposit to your account, do a payment, move you to the Ledger screen or simply exit the application.


The Ledger Screen:
This will show a similar menu to the home screen, but instead will show you, all your transactions, just your deposits or just your payments. However there is also a reports screen that you can choose to go to as well. You can move back to the Home Screen from here.


The Reports Screen:
This screen you will be able to sort your transactions by time. These will be: Month to Date, Previous Month, Year to date, Previous year, Searching by vendor, or even a custom search with the starting year to ending year, the descriptions, and vendor. NOTE: you do not need to fill out every option, just the ones you want to search for. You can move back to the Ledger Screen from here.
